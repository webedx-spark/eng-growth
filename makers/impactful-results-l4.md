### Impactful Results - Senior Software Engineer (L4)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L3, L4 engineers create more impact by:
* Delivering impact on the team's results by solving well-defined problems that may not have well-defined solutions.
* Working with stakeholders to find areas of leverage for the team.
* Being prolific in their deliverables.
* Providing multiple estimates for a project while explaining trade-offs of using different approaches.
* Contributing to decision-making in their area by actively proposing or advocating for ideas that provide high value for their cost and recommending against ideas that provide low value for their cost.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L4s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* To meet a partner deadline, they worked with the product manager to come up with multiple options for scope, sequencing, and cost.
* They pitched using a headless-CMS to rapidly iterate on marketing pages to drive top-of-funnel metrics without engineering help.
* They recognized that a quick pilot to improve module completion would be sufficient and delivered it while not over-engineering it.
* They invested in learning full-stack development at Coursera, which made them more effective at generating results across multiple end-to-end experiments.
* They identified an opportunity to reduce product complexity by unifying partner-facing views of learners' assignment submissions and custom settings configurations for those learner-assignment pairs, and executed on it.
* They collaborated heavily with Design and advocated for appropriate existing patterns/designs to enable fast product page iterations.
* They led the development of key product features leading to significant business results in terms of completions, enrollments and/or conversions.
* Though their main stack was mobile, they were able to effectively read & understand code across multiple stacks. This allowed them to move a project forward much faster by minimizing collaboration overheads.
* They identified an improvement in the experimentation framework owned by another team and were able to make a code change that enabled all of engineering to exclude degree learners from experiments
* They were critical in delivering several quarter long projects on the team in a timely fashion.
* They did a good job pushing back on product requirements that don’t make sense, for example - question if we need unsubscribe for transactional emails.
* When working on a relatively vague problem like improving data inconsistency they wrote a doc with their thoughts and shared with stakeholders (product, data) to get alignment.
* Designed the new enterprise platform which supports upsells, renewals, MBUs while keeping it simple and evaluating design tradeoffs.
* **need example for Contributing to decision-making in their area… that highlights simple pieces of tech built in-house**
* **need example for Infra**
