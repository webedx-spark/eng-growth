### Technical Excellence - Software Engineer I (L2)
L2 engineers typically demonstrate *technical excellence* by:
* Learning to write maintainable code with valuable tests.
* Learning to add monitoring and alerts for better observability into our production systems.
* Developing understanding of effective use of tools.
* Following established process and patterns on design, code and doc.
* Starting to have a good understanding of some technical areas owned by the team.
* Actively seeking guidance from peers and incorporate feedback.
* Developing quality as a habit.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L2s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* When they created diffs, they included useful unit tests that provided test coverage of the new business logic introduced.
* They update existing alerts when recognizing the settings are out-of-date.
* They took a course on Sumo Logic to have a good understanding of this important tool.
* When they did Cassandra migrations, they followed the same technique adopted for other table migrations.
* During standup they ask for guidance on cassandra migration issues and incorporate the suggestions received
* Over time, they have gotten into the habit of creating tests such that they are no longer reminded on the diffs by other engineers.
