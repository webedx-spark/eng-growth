### Technical Excellence - Senior Staff Software Engineer (L6)
L6 engineers demonstrate technical excellence by:
* Leveraging their deep domain knowledge of key technical areas of Coursera or leveraging their experience and knowledge of industry trends to drive cross-functional initiatives.
* Developing guidelines and best practices that elevate quality and excellence across engineering.
* Providing valuable insight and feedback to teams on architecture and design.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L6s at Coursera have demonstrated, or behaviors we believe would be appropriate for an L6:
* They identified and advocated cross-functional initiatives such as polyglot and gRPC.
* They proposed and architected a solution to decouple items from Courses and enable item sharing.
* They invented a unique way to do machine-assisted grading on the platform.
* They see the merit of adopting typescript and evangelized and work cross functionally to come up with a proposal and execution plan for adopting typescript.
