### Technical Excellence - Principal Software Engineer (L7)
L7 engineers demonstrate technical excellence by:
* Being recognized as a thought leader in at least one field of engineering.
* Demonstrating the ability to assess the current state of engineering architecture and determine risks and misalignments with future product directions.
* Having the ability to influence changes needed to prepare engineering for the future and facilitate the evolution of our systems.

Here are some examples of behaviors that we believe would be appropriate for an L7:
* Inventing a write ahead log system that solves the problem of providing a foundation for a reliable ledger system in a distributed environment.
* Operationalizing the write ahead log system and open sourcing the system.
