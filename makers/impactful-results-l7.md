### Impactful Results - Principal Software Engineer (L7)
L7 engineers create more impact by:
* Having a proven track record of successfully driving projects that substantially impact the entire engineering team.
* Creating new foundational technologies and patterns to enable problems specific to Coursera.
* Working closely with Engineering Leads and other Staff and Principal Engineers, developing the architectural strategy for large-scale, cross-cutting technology and product concerns

Here are some examples of behaviors that we believe would be appropriate for an L7:
* They created or were a top-10 contributor to a general technology with broad adoption, e.g. Kubernetes, and they leveraged this technology effectively to solve a core technology problem for Coursera's business.
* Through their own work as well as collaboration with multiple engineering teams, they established, socialized, and facilitated adoption of standards for microservice design throughout Coursera, which resulted in demonstrable benefits to service health and ownership.
