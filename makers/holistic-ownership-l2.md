### Holistic Ownership - Software Engineer I (L2)
L2 engineers typically *prepare to become holistic owners* by:
* Showing strong ownership on the tasks assigned to them, e.g. communicating effectively with stakeholders like their mentor or PM on the progress of the project.
* Responsibly follow up on the rollout of their deliverables
* Opportunistically making small improvements to leave things better than they found them.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L2s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They noticed some bugs or outdated information in the backend onboarding documentation, so they updated it, making our onboarding experience better.
* In order to complete the tasks assigned to them related to migrating API endpoints, they reached out to all relevant members and found out information which was not listed in the ticket
* They proactively track and address quality issues that were reported for their deliverables
