### Impactful Results - Senior Staff Software Engineer (L6)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L5, L6 engineers create more impact by:
* Having a major impact on the entire engineering team.
* Driving large engineering initiatives that increase leverage by championing significant adoption of technologies, patterns, or innovations by most engineers.
* Contributing to certain important open-source projects or external platforms that are important to Coursera.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L6s at Coursera have demonstrated, or behaviors we believe would be appropriate for an L6:
* They drove a multi-quarter project to change how permissions are handled within the Coursera system; to do this, they contributed code directly, provided detailed code and design reviews to teammates, and laid out the overall vision for both the transition plan and future changes. In addition to laying foundations for the future, this work enabled a critical feature required by a degree partner to properly administer their courses.
* **Need example for Driving large engineering initiatives that increase leverage requiring most engineers to adopt better tech/patterns.**
* **Need example for Contributing to certain important open-source projects or external platforms that are important to Coursera.**
