### Impactful Results - Staff Software Engineer (L5)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L4, L5 engineers create more impact by:
* Delivering impact on results that are of interest to the larger engineering org beyond their immediate subteam.
* Having a substantial impact on results that have benefits extending beyond their subteam.
* Working with others outside of their local team to find areas of leverage across teams.
* Building expertise in multiple domains, including a high-level understanding of related domains and interaction points with other domains.
* Identifying and implementing opportunities for high leverage with a view towards driving large business results or technical impact to multiple teams.
* Actively investing in building their domain expertise which allows various stakeholders within the company to seek their advice for maximizing impact or reducing costs.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L5s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They delivered an extremely time-sensitive major change for a key degree partner by taking a well-calculated risk of refactoring staff-graded assignments to use the compound assessments framework, which resulted in a smooth launch with no P0/P1 bugs.
* As a product engineer, they dived deep into existing AWS functionality for container orchestration to find cost-savings of over $100,000 in the Coursera Labs feature. Their expertise in relevant technology allowed them to effectively vet product code from another company to inform an acquisition.
* In the past 2 quarters, they demonstrated extraordinary velocity by contributing substantially to their teamâ€™s major projects: search (moving to a completely new platform), browse, GDPR, career pages, collections, recommendations module, LTV, experiment design and analysis, while being the tech-lead on most of them.
* They advocated for and implemented foundational changes to the mobile app's caching strategy, which improved performance on the most important user-facing pages in the app. These broad changes affected all modules and data models in the app. In addition, they migrated away from the default Apollo Cache, which improved load performance by an order of magnitude, from seconds to milliseconds.
