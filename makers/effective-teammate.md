# Effective Teammate

## Why does being an effective teammate matter?
Most of the time, software development is a collaborative process, as it involves developing something that will be used by others. All such engineering projects require teamwork. Chains are only as strong as the weakest links in them, and teams are only as good as their least helpful team player.

There are many aspects of being an effective teammate. As a baseline, we expect Courserians to behave with **empathy** and strive to **collaborate effectively** with one another; these are key to working well with your teammates over the long-term. Demonstrating **alignment** with the team's culture helps you be a core member of the community and also empowers you to influence the team culture for the better. Adopting a **team-first mindset** helps the team be more impactful by ensuring that your efforts are tightly aligned with the team's priorities and mission. Last but not least, prioritizing **learning** as well as **teaching others** ensures that you and your team can continue growing together, setting both of you up for success in the future.

## Which [engineering values](https://webedx-spark.github.io/eng-values/) and/or [leadership principles](https://coursera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEP/pages/268763323/Coursera+Leadership+Principles) align with this category?
*Engineering values*
* **Maximize impact: scale together** -- effective mentorship is high-impact work.
* **Seek clear ownership: foster aligned-autonomous teams** -- better alignment of the team with overall strategy and decisions enables everyone to be more effective. Silos put this alignment at risk, so proactively calling out these silos can help prevent us from moving in diverging directions.
* **Decide and commit: be transparent about your decisions** -- finding the right stakeholders, driving decisions, keeping a public record, and keeping the stakeholders updated of these decisions are essential to maintaining effective collaboration and alignment.
* **Decide and commit: create a safe environment for debates** -- actively listening to different opinions and engaging in healthy technical debates based on examples and facts are key to collaborating effectively.
* **Make quality a habit: embrace continuous improvement** -- conducting blameless retrospectives allows us to bring out the most in our teammates.

*Leadership principles*
* **Inspire teams to be their best:** by inspiring, listening to, empowering, and appreciating the people around us, we create an environment where we can all do our best work.
* **Own it:** taking responsibility for fixing mistakes and finding solutions, whether by fixing a specific situation or by changing an overall process, uplevels us as a team and creates a safe space for turning mistakes into potential improvements.
* **Learn, change, and grow:** being a gracious giver and recipient of feedback allows us to collaborate effectively and improve how we work, both individually and as a unit. Leaders in this area are resilient during times of change and even recruit teammates to help implement changes.
* **Love without limits:** respecting and embracing the diversity and dignity of every single one of us allows all of us to bring our best selves to work. Leaders will not only role model this but also demand this of others.

## What does progression look like?
As levels progress, the following dimensions improve:
* **Involvement:** at first, being an effective teammate may just be a matter of *aligning* yourself with the team. As you grow, you should *suggest improvements* to the status quo based on gaps you observe, and ultimately *take ownership* of certain aspects of the team culture.
* **Scope****:** at first, you may just be focused on your own personal development, but your perception of "your team" or your sphere of influence should gradually expand to *your subteam*, to *engineering* as a whole, and even to representing *Coursera* outside of Coursera.
