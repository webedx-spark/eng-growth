# Impactful Results

## Why do impactful results matter?
As an engineer, you contribute directly to customer or business value, whether through a **high volume** of feature development, platform work, code reviews, or interviews. These activities help us deliver value to users as well as scale our business. In addition, choosing approaches that **lower cost** or **raise efficiency** increase return on investment, allowing us to achieve more impact with the same resources. Finally, it's essential that we reward contributions that are aligned with **impact to the team charter and/or company mission**, rather than rewarding solutions to difficult technical problems for their own sakes.

## Which [engineering values](https://webedx-spark.github.io/eng-values/) and/or [leadership principles](https://coursera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEP/pages/268763323/Coursera+Leadership+Principles) align with this category?
*Engineering values*
* **Maximize impact: optimize for our users & business** -- avoid overengineering, and make the right build vs. buy choices that will lower the cost of long-term ownership
* **Seek clear ownership: you are empowered to change code as needed** -- the ability to get the job done by unblocking yourself in this way (e.g. by working full-stack or grokking other teams' code) can be a strong contributor to impactful results.

*Leadership principles*
* **Serve the cause:** we serve Coursera's mission by focusing first and foremost on results that are impactful to the business. We may begin by role modelling this, and later working to actively drive alignment here.
* **Increase leverage:** aligning people on the things that produce bigger results with less effort is key to improving efficiency. This may start out by aligning team members, but in many cases, the greatest gains require aligning cross-functional team members, too.

## What does progression look like?
As levels progress, the following dimensions improve:
* **Velocity:** one way of providing more value to the business is to increase velocity, or increasing the scope and volume of results you deliver. For example, if we were in the business of delivering pizza, we could create more value by being a better, faster driver, which allows us to deliver more pizzas.
* **Leverage**: as you progress, you will become more able to identify high-leverage problems affecting the team, and more able to propose high-leverage solutions. Instead of just working harder or faster, the ability to identify these solutions allows us to fundamentally change the work required by increasing efficiency or reducing costs. For example, if we were in the business of delivering pizza, we could create more leverage by finding ways to make our driving routes more efficient, or recognizing the need for pre-shredded cheese and investing in a machine that does that.
