### Impactful Results - Software Engineer I (L2)
L2 engineers typically create impactful results by:
* Contributing to features and bug-fixes.
* Making steady progress on the teamâ€™s projects.
* Actively identifying and filling technical and domain knowledge gaps in their own work.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L2s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* When an existing file upload tool became outdated and difficult to work with, they replaced usages of it from within a single app with a more polished component provided by the vendor.
* In order to support an experimental new Certs product, they built a custom description page and were responsive to requests for minor updates as it was marketed to external customers.
* _**need examples from Growth and Infra**_
