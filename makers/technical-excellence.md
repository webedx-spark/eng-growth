# Technical Excellence

## Why does technical excellence matter?
As a business, we need to balance short-term concerns like feature launches with long-term concerns like testability, maintainability, and extensibility. Building systems with the appropriate discipline ensures that current and future engineers will be able to continue delivering increasing impact to Coursera.

To build a system that is effective in the long term, you will need to demonstrate strong **design capabilities**, since the initial design of a system or feature has outsized impact on its non-functional requirements. In addition, you will need to **adopt a quality mindset** when writing code, tests, documentation, and monitoring, striving to avoid future regressions and ease maintenance work. Along the way, these tasks will require you to showcase the **breadth and depth of your technical knowledge**. Last but not least, commitment to **continuous improvement and learning** allows you to improve the excellence of the artifacts you touch on a day-to-day basis, as exemplified by leaving code better than you found it.

## Which [engineering values](https://webedx-spark.github.io/eng-values/) and/or [leadership principles](https://coursera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEP/pages/268763323/Coursera+Leadership+Principles) align with this category?
*Engineering values*
* **Maximize impact: scale together** -- though much of this value aligns with being an effective teammate, the element of leaving things better than you found them aligns well with continuous improvement and learning.
* **Decide and commit: create a safe environment for debates** -- though much of this value aligns with being an effective teammate, creating a safe environment for debates enables you to consider the right set of alternative trade-offs and designs.
* **Make quality a habit: ship with confidence** -- automated tests guard against regressions and set us up for long-term maintenance.
* **Make quality a habit: write valuable tests** -- it is not a given that any test will decrease the cost of long-term ownership. We should make sure to write good tests, to hold each other accountable for writing good tests, and to observe the [test pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html).
* **Make quality a habit: embrace continuous improvement** -- when mistakes are made, we should follow up with a pragmatic action plan to achieve the continuous-improvement-and-learning aspect of technical excellence.

## What does progression look like?
As levels progress, the following dimensions improve:
* **Scope of knowledge:** as you grow, this will increase from *team* to *company* to *industry*. This also includes depth of knowledge in your technical and/or product domains.
* **Design considerations:** mature thinkers here evaluate larger and larger number of variables and trade-offs.
* **Thought leadership:** when it comes to excellence, you will grow from *following* to *adopting* to *improving* to *influencing*, improving how you and others demonstrate excellence through docs, tests, code, and monitoring. Along the way, you will be more and more *proactive* about learning about your craft and driving improvements.
