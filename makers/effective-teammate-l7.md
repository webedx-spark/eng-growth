### Effective Teammate - Principal Software Engineer (L7)
In addition to the responsibilities of L6, L7 engineers *represent Coursera's culture outside of Coursera* by:
* Driving alignment on product and technology strategy throughout the company.
* Coaching teams and functions to make complex decision-making throughout the company.
* Attracting the best talent in the industry through technical leadership and domain expertise both within and outside Coursera.
* Maintaining velocity and flexibility of development at Coursera by using their understanding of industry trends to proactively evolve Coursera's technology choices for the future, rather than responding reactively to downturns in community or support.

Here are some examples of behaviors that we believe would be appropriate for an L7:
* They helped Coursera gain the reputation of thought leader in their area of expertise; and they are sought by renowned conferences to speak and evangelize.
* As a talent magnet, they helped Coursera hire many key individuals at key positions of influence.
* With their distinct ability to foresee technical evolution, they engineered the organization structure to become highly productive and streamlined.
