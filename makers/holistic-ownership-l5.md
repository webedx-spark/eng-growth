### Holistic Ownership - Staff Software Engineer (L5)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L4, L5 engineers *help improve the engineering team's ownership* by:
* Owning large feature areas on the team.
* Start identifying gaps in engineering-wide ownership and driving solutions for these.
* Simplifying and consolidating components, possibly across the Coursera system, in order to reduce overall complexity of the system.
* Creating interfaces to their component which are well-understood by other teams. To avoid regressions to the component, these interfaces are well-tested.
* Shipping with confidence in all of their components using approaches that scale.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L5s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They made a proposal to measure ownership metrics for the engineering organization.
* They own the entire mobile app, taking into account several aspects like crash rate, technical roadmap, code quality, coding best practices, etc.
* They have written contribution guidelines to components of ownership.
* They actively monitor the app store reviews to ensure that the feature releases actually solve the end users problems. They exhibit learner first and encourage product and design to solve the underlying problems for learners
* They split a monolith app by adding a new paradigm to our FE infrastructure, thereby making ownership better for multiple teams.
* They own the design system for Coursera by working closely with design and creating impactful UI components.
* They are a primary owner of a large part of our data model that powers many applications.
* They demonstrated ownership across authoring by introducing new on-call alerts and best practices for response to account for the low-traffic, high-stakes nature of the product. These on-call practices were adopted by the team and ultimately mirrored by other teams with similar requirements.
* **Additional examples for "owning large features areas on the team" would be useful here.**
