### Effective Teammate - Senior Software Engineer (L4)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L3, L4 engineers *demonstrate ownership of the team culture* by:
* Owning projects and acting as a point of contact for a project or initiative.
* Providing constructive feedback through design reviews.
* Building supportive relationships with cross-functional partners that depend on them.
* Helping in the project planning and calling out risks.
* Helping improve team process and culture.
* Encouraging and helping the team to upskill.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L4s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* When working on Jupyter notebook migration, substantial cross-functional communication was required because the migration occurred while degree sessions were running. They corresponded directly with the TAM for a degree program to ensure that there were no disruptions during the migration.
* When they observed different patterns (e.g. for components, stores, testing, documentation) throughout our codebase, they contributed to and coordinated guidelines to establish a standard and suggest a migration plan to make it easier for new hires to onboard onto the code.
* When they felt that their team's synchronous standups were not effective, they proposed and shepherded the change to async standups
* When driving a project spanning multiple areas (e.g. content structure, payments, enrollments), they coordinated directly with engineers on other teams to complete the project while keeping owners in the loop. In this way, these stakeholders were set up for success to continue owning their area.
* As a trusted reviewer for their team's code and designs, they contributed to the quality of the team's work by calling out edge cases and design issues during code review. They did this even for projects on which they were not a primary contributor, and for code submitted by more senior engineers.
* Since it was critical for the team to hire more engineers. They were proactive in going through interview training and advocating for a more equitable interview load.
* To help fill a gap in how Coursera evaluated engineering IC candidates' skills, they helped design a new interview with content that accurately reflects the kind of problems solved today at Coursera. As part of this process, they conducted the interview multiple times, trained others to conduct the interview, and iterated on the rubric and the process in order to improve the candidate experience and evaluation.
* They were a sounding board for Data Science when designing user targeting queries around their feature and provided insightful feedback during multiple brainstorming sessions, which led to a better system when running experiments.
* While working on XDP, they realized that there was no document which listed all supported features and product specs. They wrote a document by working closely with the web team and designers, and this document can now help future product development and testing.
* After noticing that additional context on backend development would help the client side developers to understand, empathize and execute better, they led multiple sessions to explain how things work on backend by sharing their full stack knowledge
* They helped organize meaningful design discussions in the team which was a good forum for team members to present their designs and get feedback
* They helped drive improvements to meeting schedules to make sure they are scheduled back to back to avoid context switching.
* They helped organize important events like Make-a-Thon in Toronto and when doing that made sure everyone is feeling included and participating.
* Due to their tenure at Coursera and deep understanding of our systems, they are the go to person for helping solve hard technical problems or getting feedback on design
* They helped grow the team by conducting a large number of interviews and onboarding multiple people. While doing this they received consistent praise from recruiters for doing a strong culture sell
