### Holistic Ownership - Senior Staff Software Engineer (L6)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L5, L6 engineers *demonstrate ownership of engineering *and *help improve our engineering health *by:
* Taking ownership of engineering-wide efforts.
* Thinking about higher order concerns of ownership like driving splitting of services to help make ownership more clear.
* Owning parts of the technical roadmap for engineering.
* Enabling autonomous teams by clarifying the contracts between components.
* Architecting new components that drive significant impact for Coursera.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L6s at Coursera have demonstrated, or behaviors we believe would be appropriate for an L6:
* They created a plan for 2020 on how our tech stack will evolve to embrace Polyglot architecture.
* They created a plan for item sharing, thereby creating significant new opportunity for product to innovate.
* They created a systems design for Coursera Labs, improving our technical assessments feature set for our partners and leading to significant and long lasting business results for Coursera.
