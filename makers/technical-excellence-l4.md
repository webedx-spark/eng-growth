### Technical Excellence - Senior Software Engineer (L4)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L3, L4 engineers *exemplify the standards for technical excellence* by:
* Becoming the resident expert on key technical areas owned by the team.
* Adopting and demonstrating the “Make quality a habit” mindset by writing well-documented and maintainable code. The tests written demonstrates good understanding of impactful high quality tests in addition to coverage
* Helping teammates develop the habit by championing best engineering practices, and actively seeking ways to help the team strive for excellence.
* Creating thoughtful designs that are largely their own creation, balancing new unused patterns with merit of consistency and demonstrating thoughtfulness in trade-off considerations.
* Actively participate in code reviews to help the team adopt best practices and accepted patterns.
* Starting to propose improvements and procedures that elevate the team’s technical excellence.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L4s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They developed the sales tax system, which was a novel solution that minimized changes to mission-critical code paths like the checkout flow while taking all products into account.
* They saw latency increases for the LearningHierarchy every morning, so they proactively looked into the root cause and reduced the latency such that the team would not get alerted.
* They established coding patterns of migrating Cassandra that were followed by others on the team.
* They saw another teammate working on latency issues with Teamwork service and jumped in to help triage and make fixes to bring the latency back to a healthy state.
* They wrote detailed technical artifacts for their major projects and followed up on every outage with a thorough post-mortem.
* When they see a pain point in testing learners in various stages of resit, they devise a way to generate test data such that it’s easy to simulate users in different stages.
* They took ownership of program-home which was a very fragile, error prone app and drove improvements by increasing coverage and availability. 
* When a component they owned regressed in coverage they rallied the team to add tests and make the component healthy again.
* They identified issues in how we calculate code coverage on FE and worked with infra team to fix it.
* They did a disproportionately large number of code review in the team and provided meaningful comments and suggestions in them which generally lead to better code and design
* They worked on fixing some of the most time critical and high impact issues for the team in a timely manner because they have a deep understanding and knowledge of how the system works
* They identified meaningful alerts from noise, made fixes for the highest impact errors getting help from other teams as needed and fixed the monitoring to reduce noise
* They actively identified gaps in monitoring/logging which was preventing the team from fixing issues and worked with infra on improving the logging and monitoring
* **need example of a good design appropriate for this level**
* **add example for code reviews at L4. Addressing whether or not tests are valuable / calling out missing tests, DRY, reusability**
