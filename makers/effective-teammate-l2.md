### Effective Teammate - Software Engineer I (L2)
L2 engineers typically *align with team culture* by:
* Asking for guidance and learning to be an independent member of the team.
* Learning from advice (e.g. through code reviews) and continually improving the quality of their work.
* Demonstrating enthusiasm and proactivity to learn, including owning and growing from mistakes.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L2s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* Since they had not worked with React before, they took the Coursera React course to improve their knowledge of how to write idiomatic code.
* In order to further their learning, they periodically perused diffs submitted by others to better understand common practices, even if they were not listed as a reviewer.
* When starting a new project, they participated in structured braindump sessions with a domain expert, and asked focused questions to further their understanding.
