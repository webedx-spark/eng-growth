### Holistic Ownership - Software Engineer II (L3)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L2, L3 engineers *help improve ownership* by:
* Owning at least one non-trivial feature in my team.
* Adding preventive measures around detecting issues in their areas of ownership by adding monitors, playbooks, tests for the component.
* Taking ownership of components by finding root causes for availability losses and e2e tests.
* Finding patterns of problems in the components they own and recommending solutions for the root cause of those problems.
* Documenting the component that they own to share knowledge with other members of the team and reduce bus-factor risk.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L3s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They did an opportunistic refactoring of the lecture page while fixing a bug to improve the testability of the component.
* They improved code coverage of the assignments component to reduce the number of manual tests that need to be run on this component.
* They identified that most notification errors are coming from a single root cause of incorrect hashed IDs, thereby fixing many bugs at once.
* Helped drive code coverage improvements in the team by building a tracker that people can use to divide up work.
* When working on refunds for WES contracts, they identified improvements and other latent bugs and talked to product and services to prioritize and fix them.
