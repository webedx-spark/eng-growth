### Impactful Results - Software Engineer II (L3)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L2, L3 engineers create more impact by:
* Contributing to many of the team’s objectives.
* Becoming fully productive members of the team, which means they are able to deliver well-scoped features with minimal guidance and provide meaningful code reviews to teammates.
* Estimating projects well and delivering consistently within timelines.
* Finding areas of efficiency in their work to generate more results for the team.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L3s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They implemented a reusable "tunnel vision" pattern in multiple places throughout an app, to enable more efficient user workflows and provide a consistent user experience.
* When fixing data quality issues on sessions, they automated a fix covering 99% of the cases with little effort, and addressed the remaining 1% with a monitor and manual fixes.
* As an expert on a11y, over the course of 6 months, they reviewed over 40 related diffs submitted by engineers from Andela.
* They contributed to the design and implementation of a test fixtures service, to enable maintainable automated E2E tests. Their work could be extended by others to produce additional fixture types.
* They executed on a project to reduce the number of representations of a course version and to simplify the relationships between these various representations.
* They executed on a project to update an existing data product reporting quiz-related metrics to account for features like course versioning and item sharing.
