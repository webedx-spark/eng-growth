### Effective Teammate - Software Engineer II (L3)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L2, L3 engineers *help improve the team culture* by:
* Actively participating in the team's decision-making process.
* Help the team grow by participating in hiring, mentoring, or onboarding.
* Participating in scoping product requirements.
* Voicing concerns or challenging the status quo.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L3s at Coursera have demonstrated to *help improve the team culture*:
* They were tasked with building an interface for an important degree workflow, and this project had a hard deadline; to best support the project, they created a document with detailed scoping for the different parts of the project, which helped others understand the risk level and make informed decisions for what pieces should be prioritized or done as a fast-follow.
* They conducted phone screens for entry-level (L2) candidates and sought to give them a good interview experience while evaluating them fairly for a role here.
* As a mentor for an intern or as an onboarding buddy for a new grad, they created a safe space for them to ask any questions by checking in with them regularly and patiently explaining concepts to them.
* In order to fill in gaps of temporary team resourcing, as the primarily backend engineer of a feature they contributed to the front-end work of that feature to enable fast product experiment iterations.
* They started a working group to include learning from industry best practices and adopt them in our stack
* [Need more examples here]
* code reviews - empathetic yet effective
