### Effective Teammate - Staff Software Engineer (L5)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L4, L5 engineers *help improve **engineering** culture outside of their local team* by:
* Proactively pushing for eng improvements.
* Influencing the team's charter and steering the team's direction.
* Resolving technical conflicts and bridging differences of opinion.
* Exemplifying transparent decision-making for the team.
* Helping steer Coursera's technical direction.
* Sharing the responsibilities of motivating engineers and making them productive.
* Shepherding initiatives to improve Coursera's engineering culture.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L5s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* They helped make space for creative and novel projects to better Coursera through Make-a-thon. As part of this work, they sought buy-in from members of Coursera leadership and actively worked to improve this event as it ran repeatedly.
* As a member of the Technical Architecture Group, they played a major role in driving and communicating direction on important decisions, such as polyglot and presentation layer. As part of these responsibilities, they held themselves accountable for ensuring that the engineering organization was engaged with these decisions, rather than making them unilaterally or communicating to only a select few.
* As a leader on the team, they worked directly with their manager and PM to define the team's charter and even the product roadmap.
* After conducting many phone interviews, they noticed that a phone interview question is getting old and might have been leaked, so they came up with a new question, established rubrics and conducted training to replace the old question.
* As a technical leader on the team, they inspired other engineers to pay attention to testing. They set up code coverage monitoring for the app and set up recurring weekly meetings to improve unit test code coverage.
* They wrote a document for code coverage philosophy and shared it with the broader team for buy-in. They also evangelized with the entire engineering org and helped drive a training on test coverage.
