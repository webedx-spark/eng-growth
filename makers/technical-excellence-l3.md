### Technical Excellence - Software Engineer II (L3)
In addition to the responsibilities of an L2, L3 engineers *embrace technical excellence* by:
* Developing a good understanding of some technical areas owned by the team so as to be effective in making modifications.
* Following good coding practice and writing well-tested, maintainable code.
* Ensuring monitoring and alerts are added before launching anything to production.
* Actively participating in design discussions, contributing to designs and understanding design trade-offs.
* Participate in code reviews.
* Continuously seeking to improve skills and help the team maintain high quality standards.

Here are some examples of behaviors that L3s at Coursera have demonstrated:
* When working on UoL resit feature, they wrote integration tests that caught multiple errors as other engineers commit code in the same area.
* As they work on real time notification feature, they create confluence page on how to leverage the system for other use cases.
* When they saw frequent alerting such as frequent 500 errors, instead of addressing the specific alert, they found ways to improve the system to be more resilient or self-heal so the alert would be eliminated altogether.
* Even though it wasn't their on-call, they monitored the alert chanel and took appropriate actions when needed while coordinating with the on-call person.
* When they got a lot of support tickets, they created a job such as payment fix up job to address the issue and reduce ticket volume and support time.
* When launching a critical degree feature, they wrote a detailed doc for QA handoff as well as playbook for how the feature works.
* When they saw the different ways diffs were created, they proposed a template for standardizing diff creation so best practices would be consistently adopted.
* When building new features they thought about how to build it in a reusable way so multiple teams can benefit from it.
* When building a new feature do due diligence to see if any existing technology can be leveraged.
* **add example for "basic code review checklist," e.g. that tests exist**
